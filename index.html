  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello, I'm Mark, a student at the University of California, Berkeley pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I am currently working at <a href="http://yelp.com">Yelp</a> on the Mobile Team working on a building a tool to Analyze and Visualize User Flows. I'm also a <a href="/cs61a">TA for CS61A at UC Berkeley</a>. I am passionate about web development, startups, challenging problems, and hacker culture. You can view my resume <a href="/resume">here</a>, projects <a href="/projects">here</a> and contact me <a href="/contact">here.</a> Enjoy your stay!
  </p>

  <h2>Recent Projects</h2>
  <p>
    My most recent project has been <a href="http://appsearch.es">Appsearch.es</a>, an iOS app search engine that allows you to filter and sort through various iOS apps. The most interesting part about the project was making a worker that would collect data every night so that the database was always up to date. I am currently tracking the positions of the top 300 apps and I hope to be able to use that data in a couple weeks to measure the performance of certain types of apps on the App Store.
