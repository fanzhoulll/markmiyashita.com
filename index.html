            My name is Mark Miyashita and I am a student at the University of California, Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I have a passion for computer science and creating content for the world to benefit from. Currently, I am the author and editor of <a href="http://hints.binaryage.com">Mac Hints from BinaryAge</a>. This site is built using Jekyll, a new static-post content creator, and hosted using Github Pages. In addition to coding websites and small side projects, I am also learning Python, Objective-C, and Unix to broaden my skill set. I am also interested in data analytics, check out my <a href="http://github.com/negativetwelve">Github</a> page for large-scale data projects I am working on, as well as my <a href="{{site.url}}/productivity">productivity blog post</a> for insights into my daily technology usage that I have been tracking.
