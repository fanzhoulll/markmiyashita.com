  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello, I'm Mark, a student at the University of California, Berkeley pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I am currently working at <a href="http://yelp.com">Yelp</a> on the Mobile Team working on a building a tool to Analyze and Visualize User Flows. I'm also a <a href="/cs61a">TA for CS61A at UC Berkeley</a>. I am passionate about web development, startups, challenging problems, and hacker culture. You can view my resume <a href="/resume">here</a>, projects <a href="/projects">here</a> and contact me <a href="/contact">here.</a> Enjoy your stay!
  </p>

  <h2>Recent Projects</h2>
  <p>
    At the most recent hackathon at Yelp, I worked on a team of 4 to create Pound Pong, an iPad app with a JSON API and Arduino RFID scanner that allows you to 'badge' into your ping pong matches using our Yelp badges. From there, your profile is loaded from the server and after your match has finished, you label the winner. From there, we calculate the point difference between the two players using official ping pong rules and compute a rank for your user profile. I worked on the iPad app mainly getting the login flow to work with the RFID scanner.

    Between working at Yelp and TAing, I've also been working on an iOS app which communicates with a JSON API to form a dynamic game that involves raising and training creatures! Promo page is coming soon but you can always ask me about it and I always carry around a working demo on my phone.
