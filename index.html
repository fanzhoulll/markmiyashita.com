        <div class="post">
          <p>My name is Mark Miyashita and I am a student at the University of California, Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I have a passion for computer science and creating content for the world's benefit. I am currently a Software Engineering Intern at <a href="http://www.inigral.com/">Inigral Inc.</a>, a startup in San Francisco focusing on creating a social environment for higher education. I am also a Course Reader for both <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa12/">CS61A</a> and <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs10/fa12/">CS10</a>, two computer science classes here at Berkeley. My role as a reader is to provide feedback on good code practices, helping students write concise, readable, and efficient code, as well as grading their assignments. I am also a Residential Computing Consultant at <a href="https://www.rescomp.berkeley.edu/units/u2/">ResComp</a> on the Berkeley Campus where I help students in the residential halls troubleshoot their internet and general computer problems, as well as providing workshops to teach the residents about safe practices and software on their computers. Lastly, I am the author and editor of <a href="http://hints.binaryage.com">Mac Hints from BinaryAge</a> a website designed to help general or experienced Mac users with tutorial and hints on how to solve basic and advanced problems.</p>
            
        <p>On the software development side, I am proficient in Ruby on Rails, Python, Java, iOS Development, HTML, CSS, and Scheme. I also have experience in Javascript, Coffescript, jQuery, Ajax, and Sass. You can check out my Github <a href="https://github.com/negativetwelve/">here</a> and my LinkedIn <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/mark-miyashita/38/63/49">here.</a> Lastly, I am working on a large scale Ruby On Rails app called Pets Alliance; it has three components, a web app, iOS app, and later a Facebook app. This has been my main side project and I am very excited about it.
