# Using Jekyll

The site is built using [https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll](Jekyll), a static blog generator that was built by [https://github.com/mojombo](mojombo). It works seamlessly with [http://pages.github.com/](Github Pages) which allows you to deploy your website just by pushing to a branch on your repo. After the initial set up time, adding content to the blog is a breeze.

# Structure

### _config.yml

Contains general configuration for Jekyll and also the information that is formatted on my resume, projects page, and also where I define variables for other parts of the site. My work is listed as an array which I can iterate over and it allows me to keep my information all in one spot. If you have any suggestions about how I should structure it, please let me know!

### CNAME

The CNAME file allows me to easily point my repo to my own personal domain. After setting up my DNS settings to point to Github, I don't have to worry about hosting or anything like that.
