<p><a href="http://imbyter.com"><img class="clear blog-image-full-border" width="480" height="235" src="http://markmiyashita.com/images/imbyter.png" title="imbyter.com"></a></p>

<p>imbyter.com started off as a side project driven by my previous success with a small wordpress blog that I started during high school. I realized that there was a market for tutorials, hints, and fixes that large technology companies failed to help their end-users with. As a result, I created imbyter.com in December of 2011 and it was an instant success. By February of 2012, the site had blossomed to over 45,000 views with some days reaching as many as 3,000 pageviews. Because of its success and the large audience that I attracted, I was hired by BinaryAge to work on a subsection of their site with the same mindset and goals in mind, to help end-users fix their software, phone problems, and computer problems. As a result, I no longer regularly post on imbyter.com and instead have directed all of my articles to <a href="http://hints.binaryage.com">Mac Hints from BinaryAge</a>. I keep imbyter.com active for anyone who wants to use the site for inspiration.</p>

<p>I have recently been signed to do some freelancer work for a BinaryAge led by the developer of the popular apps TotalFinder and TotalTerminal. I am in charge of running the subdomain hints.binaryage.com where I maintain the structure of the site as well as regularly post articles, tutorials, etc. The site runs on a platform called Jekyll, a simple static page generator, and it is hosted on Github using Github Pages.</p>

<p>For our second project, my partner and I designed a Sudoku solver and board gernator using the BYOB platform. I was in charge of the algorithm for solving the board. What makes our project different from standard solvers is that it can solve any size board with any number on inputs, the only changing factor is time. To solve the board in the fastest way possible, my algorithm involves several techniques including constraint propagation and recursive backtracking. The second mode of our project involves a generator which strategically uses the original standard board (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) for the first row, then shift by three for the second, and shuffles the board up in a way that produces a completely random board each time. The success of this project was immense, my partner and I were selected to present our project at CS Education Day at Cal in the Winter of 2011.</p>

<p>My partner and I designed a game for our CS 10 class at Berkeley. In this game, the played is instructed about the dangers of obesity as they play a fun game trying to achieve a high score. The background scrolls as the figure "runs" giving the illusion of a running character. As the player jumps from building to building, they have the option to pick up or avoid certain foods. Watch out! Some foods increase your weight significantly which causes your character to slowly fall off the edge of the screen. You must balance your diet to win this thrilling game!</p>
