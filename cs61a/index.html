  <p>
    This is the first course in the CS61 series at UC Berkeley. The course focuses on the ideas of abstraction, program complexity, functional programming, object-oriented programming, and more. The language used in the course is Python although this course is not designed to focus primarily on the language. Students go through many different topics to expose them to many key ideas in computer science.
