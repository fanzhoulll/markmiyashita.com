  <h2>Practice Problems and Notes</h2>
  <p>
    On the left of this page is a list of topics that we have covered throughout this semester. Those topic pages contain notes and practice problems that I have written to test your knowledge! If you have any questions about the problems, feel free to leave a comment on that post or send me an email! Lastly, if there is a topic that you feel you need practice on and it is not listed on the left, shoot me an email and I'll do my best to come up with some content for that topic.
