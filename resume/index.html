  <h2>Experience</h2>
  
  <h2>Software Engineering Intern - Mobile Team at Yelp</h2>
  <h3>(May '13 - Present)</h3>
  <p>
    As an intern on the Mobile Team, I built a flow analysis tool that allows you to breakdown and visualize user flows from the app. It also enables a visual interface for A/B testing and breakdown of data by dimensions. Gave a technical presentation to all of Yelp Engineering about the architecture of my project and how to extend it. I also worked on improving performance for some of our back-end processing, worked with analytics on the mobile apps, and added a few minor features to the iOS app.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Undergraduate Student Instructor for CS61A at UC Berkeley</h2>
  <h3>(Jan. '13 - Present)</h3>
  <p>
    I am an Undergraduate Student Instructor for the introductory computer science course, CS61A at UC Berkeley. I teach two sections, hold office hours, prepare discussion notes, create labs, and also lead review sessions. My TA ratings are located <a href="https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/coursesurveys/instructor/7419">here.</a>
  </p>
  
  <h2>Software Engineer at Kloudless</h2>
  <h3>(Dec. '12 - May '13)</h3>
  <p>
    I worked on adding automation for attachments by adding a stream that listens for new emails and then processes a set of user-defined rules. The stream is an abstraction for Storm, a distributed realtime computation system.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Software Engineer Intern at Inigral Inc.</h2>
  <h3>(Jul. '12 - Dec. '12)</h3>
  <p>
    I worked on both the front and back-end of Inigral's large scale Rails app. On the back-end, I worked to optimize database queries as well as fix bugs that involved the administrative panels. On the front-end, I fixed several issues dealing with the appearance of the communities pages.
  </p>
  
  <h2>CS10 Head Reader at UC Berkeley</h2>
  <h3>(Aug. '12 - Dec. '12)</h3>
  <p>
    As the Head Reader for the undergraduate course CS10, I not only grade homework, projects, and exams, but also work with Professor Dan Garcia to deal with logistics and delegation of work among the readers.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Residential Computing Consultant at UC Berkeley SA-IT</h2>
  <h3>(May '12 - May '13)</h3>
  <p>
    I provide technical support and customer service on topics such as computer software, security, and general hardware configurations for all students living in university-owned housing. I also lead workshops geared towards teaching students about being safe on the web.
  </p>
  
  <h2>CS61A Reader at UC Berkeley</h2>
  <h3>(May '12 - Dec. '12)</h3>
  <p>
    This semester, working with Professor John DeNero, my job is to focus on coding style within projects. I help students become both precise and concise in their code while still keeping it readable and manageable.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Website Developer/Editor at Mac Hints from BinaryAge</h2>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  
  <h2>Pound Pong
      
      <a href="https://github.com/negativetwelve/ping-pong-ipad">(repo)</a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Initially, the idea started out as a web app that would keep track of all of the Ping Pong matches that went on at the Yelp office. However, the project quickly transitioned into much more. Using an RFID scanner hooked up to an Arduino which is hooked up to the iPad, we can communicate with the application using our badges which all happen to be RFID. From there, we can 'badge' into our matches and record the winner in a seamless transaction using nothing more than our badges and a single tap to label the winner. Results are sent to a simple Flask server through a JSON API where they are stored in a Mongo Database. This was a project that I worked on with a group of 4 at our semi-annual Yelp hackathon. We had two people working on the Flask server / front-end of the website and two of us (including me) working on the iPad app and getting it to communicate with the RFID scanner.
  </p>
  
  <h2>iOS (currently unnamed) game with JSON API
      
      
  </h2>
  <p>
    I've been working on an iOS game that has a Rails JSON backend and will eventually have a web component too. Promo video and web page coming soon.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Global Snapshot
      <a href="http://globalsnapshot.herokuapp.com/">(demo)</a>
      <a href="https://github.com/japhethwong/global-snapshot">(repo)</a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Working on a group of three at the LinkedIn Hack Day 2013, we buit a realtime Twitter and Flickr visualizer. Watch as tweets and photos fall onto the map and as the photos form a realtime stream on the sidebar. Want to see more photos? Simply expand the sidebar by pressing the toggle button on the bottom right. Hover over any of the dots to view the tweet or photo from that location. Node.js backend while working with several APIs including Google Maps, Twitter Realtime, and Flickr Realtime. Also uses Socket.io for sending the data to the browser in realtime.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Calaborate
      <a href="http://calaborate.herokuapp.com">(demo)</a>
      <a href="https://github.com/negativetwelve/calaborate">(repo)</a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    I worked as the lead developer on a small team to develop a tool for Cal students to create meetups and study sessions to review for midterms and finals.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Appsearch.es
      <a href="http://appsearch.es">(demo)</a>
      <a href="https://github.com/negativetwelve/appsearches">(repo)</a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    An iOS app search engine. Data is gathered using a scrapper that I built and stored in a Postgres database. Search is done by indexing the database and using Postgres built-in full-text search.
