    I worked on a team of four at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/279390882175206/">2012 Battle of the Bay Facebook Hackathon</a>. We built an event logger for your computer that logs mouse clicks, application switches, and keystrokes. Then we analyzed and displayed the data using jquery graphs.
