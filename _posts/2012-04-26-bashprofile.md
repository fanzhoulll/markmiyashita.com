I fostered the idea of [bashprofile.com][bashprofile] from the success of my technology websites, [imbyter.com][imbyter] and [hints.binaryage.com][hints]. My idea was that there are millions of users in the world that stumble upon thousands of computer problems everyday and they don't know how to solve them. Instead they pay exorbitant amounts of money to fix trivial problems. This is where I come in. **I translate technical jargon into layman's terms for the general public to benefit from.** I believe that each user should be able to solve all of their computer problems on their own; this idea revolves around the idea that they should be able to solve 99% of their problems using a simply search query. That's where my site comes in. Bashprofile is a collection of tips, tutorials, how-to's, and guides aimed directly at the non-technical crowd. These users come to my site to learn, to solve, and to fix their own computer problems. The guides that I write are laid out in a way that most people can read them. In addition to guides and tutorials to fix computer related problems, users can also pick up a programming language using my easy to follow guides.
