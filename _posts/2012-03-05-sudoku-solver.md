For our second project, my partner and I designed a Sudoku solver and board gernator using the BYOB platform. I was in charge of the algorithm for solving the board. What makes our project different from standard solvers is that it can solve any size board with any number on inputs, the only changing factor is time. To solve the board in the fastest way possible, my algorithm involves several techniques including constraint propagation and recursive backtracking. The second mode of our project involves a generator which strategically uses the original standard board (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) for the first row, then shift by three for the second, and shuffles the board up in a way that produces a completely random board each time. The success of this project was immense, my partner and I were selected to present our project at CS Education Day at Cal in the Winter of 2011.
