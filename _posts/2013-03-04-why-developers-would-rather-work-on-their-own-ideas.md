"Looking for developers to work on early-stage startup!"

"I am about to start a company and could use a few developers to help me make my product!"

"Looking for experienced web developer with a minimum of 2-3 years full stack experience and proficient in both back-end and front-end technologies such as HTML5, CSS, and Javascript."

These quotes all sound the same and they are said all too often. What's even better is when they add a line or two at the end such as: "About to be funded!" or "Compensation will be in free food and great friends!" Those lines are real attention grabbers. They make me really want to join their cause right away no doubt.

I'm speaking from a university student's perspective, but I would guess that the same conversations happen everywhere in the software engineering world. A bright, young businessman fresh out of the top business schools in the country, looking for a way to make their mark on the world. What better way to start than to send out a mass email to get some free labor out of some young software engineers? 

There are only three situations in which I will seriously work on a project during my free time and they are as follows:

1. The project is my own which means that I am greatly interested in the idea or the technologies being used. I'm also extremely passionate about working on the project meaning I will <b>make</b> time to work on the project rather than dreading the number of hours that I will have to put into something uninteresting or boring.
2. The project is a collaborative project with a couple of friends or people that I know/have met in person -- not over the internet.
3. The project is for a paid position -- and even when this happens, the project better interest me or else I will just look elsewhere.

The underlying theme throughout these situations is simple; <b>interest and passion</b> drive developers towards interesting projects. Sending out an email to a large email list is one of the least successful ways to attract attention. You'd have more luck visitng a local hackathon -- in person -- and talking to developers about what they are working on, than sending out these emails.

In terms of attracting developers with money, in Silicon Valley, software engineer <i>interns</i> can make upwards of $15,000 - $20,000 <i>in a single summer</i> working at companie like Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Palantir, Yelp, etc. You're going to have a hard time competing with those price tags no matter how well funded your company is. 

Another thing you have to keep in mind is this: Developers have the ability to make their own products. Therefore, they are faced with a special situation. They can either join forces with you (a random business person) and end up splitting the success 50/50. They could join up with some of their business friends, whom they probably trust much more than you, and split that success 50/50. Or they can even try to develop the product on their own and take 100% of the success/failure. 

<h4>tl;dr</h4>
Developers are in high demand. There are lots of alternatives to working on a project with someone who they have never met or talked to before. In terms of money, larger companies and even most startups are hard to compete with as most developers are able to find positions in companies where they can make <i>a lot</i> more money. My advice to you: make friends with people in the software industry. Stop sending out blind emails to random groups who you think <i>might</i> be interested in your project. Instead, go to conferences, hackathons, and events centered around the technologies or fields that you are looking to explore and seek developers there. I would much rather talk to someone who can pitch their idea to me and show me that they are genuninely passionate about their own product rather than read some generic email that was shotgunned out to anyone and everyone.
