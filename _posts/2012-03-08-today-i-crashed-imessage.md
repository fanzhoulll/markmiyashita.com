Today, I tried sending a 1,690,000 character long iMessage to someone from my computer. For the past hour and a half, iMessage on both my computer and the person who I was communicating with has been frozen. Force close and reopening Messages does not work. I want to call this a bug report and send it to Apple, but I do not believe that many users would ever reach this extreme test case. Nevertheless, I am disappointed, but I cannot complain because Messages is still in Beta on Mac OS X Lion.
