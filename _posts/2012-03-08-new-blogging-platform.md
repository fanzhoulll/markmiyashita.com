Site is back up live!

If you viewed this site a few days ago...sorry about that. I recently switched over from the Wordpress platform to a more robust (in my opinion) static page generator, Jekyll. I was recently hired to work at <a href="http://hints.binaryage.com">BinaryAge</a> where I was introduced to Jekyll and I really liked the "hacker" interface implemented into blogging. So for a few days, my site was down because I redirected the DNS from my previous hosting to Github Pages. Now, the site is back up, this time with a more minimalist approach. Please let me know if you would like to learn more about Jekyll or hosting your blog on Github Pages. Shoot me an email at negativetwelve[at]gmail[dot]com.
