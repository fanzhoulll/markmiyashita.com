My name is Mark Miyashita and I am a student at the University of California, Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I have a passion for computer science and creating content for the world to benefit from. Currently, I am the author and editor of <a href="http://hints.binaryage.com">Mac Hints from BinaryAge</a>. This site is built using Jekyll, a new static-post content creator, and hosted using Github Pages. In addition to coding websites and small side projects, I am also learning Python, Objective-C, and Unix to broaden my skill set.
