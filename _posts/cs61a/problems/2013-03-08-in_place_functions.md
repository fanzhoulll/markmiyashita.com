<p>
  This weeks homework had a lot of problems where we wanted you to solve them in-place (meaning without creating a new list). Instead, we wanted you to swap the items in the list and directly modify the input list. Here are a few more practice problems to make sure that you understand how in-place functions work.

<pre class="brush: python;">
  
</pre>

{% if page.solution %}
<button onclick="toggleSolution()">Toggle Solution</button>

<div class="solution">
  <pre class="brush: python;">
    
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    
  </p>
</div>
{% endif %}
