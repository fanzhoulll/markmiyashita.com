<p>
  Write a function that emulates the fucntionality of <code>map</code> but for our implementation of rlists. You may use the functions we have been working with: <code>first</code> and <code>rest</code>.
</p>

<pre>
  <code class="prettyprint">
def map_rlist(fn, r):
    """
    >>> r = rlist(2, rlist(3, rlist(5, empty_rlist)))
    >>> map_rlist(lambda x: x*x, r)
    (4, (9, (25, None)))
    """
    "***YOUR CODE HERE***"
  </code>
</pre>

{% if page.solution %}

<div class="solution">
  <pre>
    <code class="prettyprint">
def map_rlist(fn, r):
    if r == empty_rlist
        return r
    return rlist(fn(first(r)), map_rlist(fn, rest(r)))
    </code>
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    We want to apply the function, fn, to each item of the rlist so we're going to need to access eah element individually. To do this, we will use recursion to recursively map over the rest of the rlist. We will return the newly created rlist by using the constructor <code>rlist</code> which takes in a first and a rest. The first element will be the original first element with the function applied to it.
  </p>
