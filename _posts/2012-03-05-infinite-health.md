My partner and I designed a game for our CS 10 class at Berkeley. In this game, the played is instructed about the dangers of obesity as they play a fun game trying to achieve a high score. The background scrolls as the figure "runs" giving the illusion of a running character. As the player jumps from building to building, they have the option to pick up or avoid certain foods. Watch out! Some foods increase your weight significantly which causes your character to slowly fall off the edge of the screen. You must balance your diet to win this thrilling game!
