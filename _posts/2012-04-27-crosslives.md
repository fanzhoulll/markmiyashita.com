It's about time our lives crossed together.

From the wise words of one of my fellow cofounders, Ronald AnSiy:<br/>
"Our startup stemmed from a simple, yet universal problem: community fragmentation. On Facebook, we can view our entire personal network on one universal site. On the public sphere, you weave through several websites to engage in various communities. It’s the reason why message board users usually consist of the more hardcore loyalists. It takes a lot of effort—too much effort."

That is our mission statement. I am one of the lead developers and cofounders of our startup [Crosslives][crosslives]. The site is built using Ruby on Rails and a variety of other web development tools. Stemming from a simple idea, the site has grown tremendously since I first jumped on board in early 2012. The limits of this idea are endless. A few more words from Ronald:

"We’re glad our lives crossed together for this experiment. None of us know what will happen from this, but we can guarantee it will be a crazy ride."
