  Write a function that emulates the fucntionality of <code>map</code> but for our implementation of rlists. You may use the functions we have been working with: <code>first</code> and <code>rest</code>.

<pre class="brush: python;">
  def map_rlist(fn, f):
      """
      >>> r = rlist(2, rlist(3, rlist(5, empty_rlist)))
      >>> map_rlist(lambda x: x*x, r)
      (4, (9, (25, None)))
      """
