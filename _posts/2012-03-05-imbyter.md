imbyter.com started off as a side project driven by my previous success with a small wordpress blog that I started during high school. I realized that there was a market for tutorials, hints, and fixes that large technology companies failed to help their end-users with. As a result, I created imbyter.com in December of 2011 and it was an instant success. By February of 2012, the site had blossomed to over 45,000 views with some days reaching as many as 3,000 pageviews. Because of its success and the large audience that I attracted, I was hired by BinaryAge to work on a subsection of their site with the same mindset and goals in mind, to help end-users fix their software, phone problems, and computer problems. As a result, I no longer regularly post on imbyter.com and instead have directed all of my articles to <a href="http://hints.binaryage.com">Mac Hints from BinaryAge</a>. I keep imbyter.com active for anyone who wants to use the site for inspiration.
