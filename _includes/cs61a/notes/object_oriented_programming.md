  <h4>Introduction</h4>

  <p>
    Object oriented programming is a type of programming centered around the idea that everything can be described as an object. Objects contain information about itself. We can divide our objects into classes which allow us to define frameworks from which our objects are constructed. We can <i>instantiate</i> multiple objects using the same class as the framework. We can defined attributes for our objects that tell us information about either the entire class or just the object itself. We can also create methods that allow our objects to do things. We can create subclasses that have the same attributes of the parent class. Lastly, we can inherit methods and attributes from our parent class to reduce the amount of code in our classes and to abstract all the details away. All of these terms might start to get confusing so let's take a few moments to define some vocabulary that will be used throughout the rest of this post.

  <h4>Vocabulary</h4>

    Object oriented programming is fairly simple, but at the very beginning it is easy to get confused on the vocabulary that we use to describe everything. So, we will use this section to define some vocabulary to help clear up the confusion. First I will define the terms, then I will provide an example that will label what everything is.

    <u>Class</u> - A class is the framework that describes a set of objects that it can create. You need a class in order to differentiate objects from one another. Some built-in classes include the List, String, Int, and Tuple classes.

    <u>Object</u> - An object is what is created by a class. We call it <i>an instance of the class</i>. Objects contain information about the specific instance and it also has methods which allow our objects to do things.

    <u>Method</u> - A method
